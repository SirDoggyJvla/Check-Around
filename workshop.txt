description=[quote=SirDoggyJvla]
description=Hello everyone !
description=
description=Mod got updated to B42 and at the same time I changed its name to Check Around ! In B41 the name is still Check Upstairs however and I did not change anything there so you shouldn't get any problems with it.

description=Ever felt like peaking through a window or door or looking upstairs or downstairs was a natural human trait ? 
description=
description=Now you can do it in Project Zomboid ! Saving you from those nasty floors hiding zombies upstairs, or even downstairs ! You can also check behind windows or door ! But peaking a closed door can have risks and cause a creeking sound that can attract zombies in the next room ! Or even players...
