Ever felt like peaking through a window or door or looking upstairs or downstairs was a natural human trait ?

Now you can do it in Project Zomboid ! Saving you from those nasty floors hiding zombies upstairs, or even downstairs ! You can also check behind windows or door ! But peaking a closed door can have risks and cause a creeking sound that can attract zombies in the next room ! Or even players...

[h1]Customization available to other modders[/h1]
Other modders can easily modify the mod and its parameters ! Add your own voicelines or modify the name to show above zombies or in the voicelines ! For example, [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3248766883]The Last of Us Infected[/url] will not mention "zombies" but instead "infected".
